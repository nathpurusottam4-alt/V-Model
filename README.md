# V-Model
The V-Model, also known as the Verification and Validation model, is a software development model that emphasizes the relationship between development phases and their corresponding testing phases. It’s an extension of the traditional Waterfall model, and it visualizes the process in the shape of the letter "V," hence the name.

The V-Model is highly structured, with each development phase having a corresponding testing phase. It ensures that each development activity is directly linked to a testing activity.
Verification (Left Side of the V)
1. Requirement Gathering:

Objective: To collect and analyse the business requirements from the customer.

Output: Requirements Specification document.

Testing Phase: Acceptance Testing. This ensures that the final product meets the customer’s requirements.
2. System Analysis:

Objective: To study the requirements in detail and define the system architecture and model.

Output: System design specifications.

Testing Phase: System Testing. This validates the overall system's functionality as per the system specifications.
3. Software Design:
TEST

 Objective: To break down the system into smaller, more manageable modules and create a detailed design for each.

 Output: Detailed design documents specifying the internal logic of each module.

 Testing Phase: Integration Testing. This checks the interaction between the integrated modules and ensures they work together as intended.
4. Module Design:

 Objective: To design the logic and internal functioning of individual modules.

 Output: Module specifications, such as pseudocode or flowcharts.

 Testing Phase: Unit Testing. This tests individual modules or components to ensure they function correctly.
5. Coding:

 Objective: The actual implementation of the modules by writing code based on the module design.

 Output: Source code for the software.

 Testing Phase: Coding itself is not directly tested but leads to the testing phases on the right side.
Validation (Right Side of the V)
1. Unit Testing:

 Objective: To test individual modules or components in isolation to ensure they perform as expected.

 Input: Module specifications and code.

 Output: Tested modules that function correctly.
2. Integration Testing:

 Objective: To test the interaction and integration of modules to ensure they work together.

 Input: Integrated modules.

 Output: An integrated system that functions correctly across modules.
3. System Testing:

 Objective: To test the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the system specifications.

 Input: The fully integrated system.

 Output: A system that meets the defined system requirements and functions correctly as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing:

 Objective: To validate that the entire system meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery to the customer.

 Input: The fully tested system.

 Output: A product that meets the customer’s requirements and is ready for deployment.
TEST
Flow:

 The V-Model flows sequentially from requirement gathering to coding (left side of the V) and then moves to corresponding testing stages (right side of the V).

 Each stage on the left side has a corresponding testing phase on the right side to ensure the product is built correctly and fulfils the requirements.
Advantages:

 Early Detection of Defects: The corresponding testing phases ensure that defects are identified early in the development process.

 Structured Approach: The clear structure of the V-Model makes it easy to manage and understand.

 Verification and Validation: Ensures that the product meets the customer’s requirements and is built correctly.
Disadvantages:

 Inflexibility: The V-Model is rigid and does not easily accommodate changes once a phase is completed.

 Not Suitable for Complex Projects: It may not be ideal for complex projects where requirements are likely to change frequently.

 High Risk: If any changes are needed, it may require going back through multiple phases, which can be costly and time-consuming.
